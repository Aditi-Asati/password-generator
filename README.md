# Password Generator

This program creates a password with number of characters as provided by the user. 
## Implementation

The generated password contains atleast one lower case letter, one upper case letter, one digit, and one special character (which are all generated randomly). 

The type of other characters of the password and the character itself are generated randomly by the program.

It also saves the created passwords in a file named `passwords.txt` along with the timestamp of password creation.
